# Cash Quest - Transaction Tracker

## Web App using Ruby, SQL, Sinatra, HTML & CSS

This is my first project at CodeClan (Week 5/16) where I have been tasked with designing a 'money dashboard' type app where the user can manage their transactions. Cash Quest has a fantasy RPG theme (think Baldur's Gate etc.), where the player/hero can add recent transactions displaying the amount, date, merchant and category. The minium viable product spec is as follows.


### MVP:
- Create new transactions
- Display a list of all transactions
- Display total amount spent
- Display total amount spent by tag


### I added the following extensions to Cash Quest:
- CRUD actions for transactions, merchants and categories
- Added dates for each transaction
- Added total spend by month functionality


### Reflection
I really enjoyed creating my first project, and managed to complete the MVP with no major issues. I feel very comfortable with HTML & CSS, I'm happy with SQL, but could spend some more time on Ruby syntax (as this is where the majority of my issues stemmed from). Whilst my inital project plans were adequate; I feel if I planned my extensions (and their integration) better this would have led to less time consuming issues. Overall, this was an intresting and challenging project where I learned a great deal.


### Potential Future Extensions:
- Add a budget with a limit 
- Add merchant profile pages
- Add merchant map
- Change date to quests
- Summary spending by quest
- Add quest reward function
- User Login



For the sake of posterity I will not continue to work on Cash Quest in this repo. It will remain an insight into my capabilities at this point in time (09/03/2018).
